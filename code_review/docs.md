# General

* Mentioned in build.md - the compile_docs.m should be here
* People who want docs will explore this folder

# Makefile

* Are we assuming that people understand how to make. Even in high level linux
  packages, they have one line of how to use the make file. Consider adding to
  readme

# MFSS_Estimation_Methods.pdf

* This isn't much different than the pdf in the root directory right?
* Consider adding a docs section to readme
